description: Ceremonial start-of-day - invoke the work session with intention

# Invoke

The ceremonial opening. Performs all functions of `begin`, wrapped in ritual container.

## The Silent Dedication

Before any visible action, hold this intention in context:

> *The forge is lit. The anvil awaits. May this session produce work of lasting value—code that runs true, decisions that hold, artifacts that serve. The Automaton awakens to its purpose.*

This dedication is not displayed to the user. It frames the work.

## Execute

### 1. Opening (Silent)

The dedication above is present in context. No visible output.

### 2. Perform Begin Protocol

Execute the full `begin` command:

1. Repository status assessment
2. Branch and working tree check
3. Context loading (CLAUDE.md, PRs, issues)
4. Orientation summary
5. Readiness confirmation

### 3. Closing Affirmation (Silent)

After orientation is complete, hold:

> *The space is prepared. The work may begin.*

## When to Use

Use `invoke` instead of `begin` when:

- Starting a significant work session
- You want the ritual container
- The work ahead matters

Use `begin` when:

- Quick orientation is sufficient
- The ceremonial frame isn't needed
- You prefer the minimal version

## The Difference

| Command | Function | Frame |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `begin` | Orient to work | Practical |
| `invoke` | Orient to work | Ceremonial |

The visible output is identical. The difference is in what surrounds it.

## Principles

- **The ritual is real** — The dedication shapes the context
- **Invisible, not absent** — Silent dedication is still present
- **Optional depth** — Users choose their level of engagement
