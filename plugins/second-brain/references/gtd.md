# GTD Reference

## Five Stages

1. **Capture** - Get it out of your head
2. **Clarify** - What is it? Actionable?
3. **Organize** - Route to appropriate list
4. **Reflect** - Review regularly
5. **Engage** - Do with confidence

## Two-Minute Rule

If action takes <2 minutes, do it now during processing.

## Weekly Review

- Process all inboxes to zero
- Review all active projects (ensure next action exists)
- Review waiting-for items
- Review calendar (past + upcoming)
- Review someday/maybe

## Four Criteria for Action Selection

1. **Context** - What can you do here?
2. **Time** - How much do you have?
3. **Energy** - How much do you have?
4. **Priority** - What's most important?
