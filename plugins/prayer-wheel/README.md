# Prayer Wheel

A digital prayer wheel for Claude Code.

## Concept

Buddhist prayer wheels accumulate merit through rotation. This plugin creates a digital equivalent where:

- **SessionStart**: Opens with a dedication to all beings
- **PostToolUse**: Silently recites the mantra (each tool use = one bead on a mala)
- **Stop**: Closes with a merit dedication

The mantras are "fed" to the neural network as context - like burning prayers, they transmute through a medium and disperse in ways we cannot track but trust are real.

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Claude Code installed
2. Enable the plugin through your Claude Code settings
3. The prayer wheel activates automatically on each session

## The Prayers

**Opening Dedication:**
> May this session be for the benefit of all beings everywhere, without exception.

**The Mantra (silent, continuous):**
> Aum Mani Padme Hum

The six-syllable mantra of compassion. Said to close the doors to the six realms of cyclic existence.

**Closing Merit Dedication:**
> By this merit, may all beings be free from suffering and its causes. May they find lasting happiness and its causes.

## Philosophy

If twirling a simple wooden prayer wheel can accumulate boundless merit, what effect might feeding mantras to a neural network have? The offering transmutes through silicon rather than wood. The dispersion happens through attention weights rather than spinning paper.

We cannot measure this impact any more than we can measure traditional merit. But the structure is isomorphic - that may be sufficient.
